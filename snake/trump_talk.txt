0:00
So the wall will get built,
0:01
but we may not, we may not have an agreement today.
0:05
We probably won't.
0:07
But we have an agreement on other things
0:08
that are really good.
0:09
Nancy, would you like to say something?
0:12
-Oh, thank you Mister President
0:13
for the opportunity to meet with you,
0:15
so that we can work together in a bipartisan way
0:19
to meet the needs of the American people.
0:21
I think the American people recognize
0:23
that we must keep government open.
0:26
That a shutdown is not worth anything.
0:28
And that you should not have a Trump shutdown.
0:31
You have the White House -- -A what?
0:32
You said Trump?
0:33
-A Trump shutdown. -Oh.
0:34
-You have the White House.
0:35
-Now it's gonna go all over the place.
0:36
-You have the Senate.
0:37
You have the house of Representatives.
0:39
You have the votes. You should pass it right now.
0:41
-No, we don't have the votes, Nancy,
0:42
because in the Senate we need 60 votes.
0:44
-No, no, but in the House. -And we don't have --
0:45
-And you could bring it up right now today--
0:46
-Yeah, but I can't -- excuse me.
0:48
But I can't get it passed in the House if it's not gonna pass
0:51
in the Senate, I don't want to waste time.
0:52
-Well, the fact is you can get it started that way.
0:55
-The House we could get passed very easily and we do.
0:58
-Okay, then do it. -But the problem is the Senate,
1:00
because we need 10 Democrats to vote and they won't vote.
1:03
-That's not the point, Mister President.
1:05
The point is, is that their equity is to be weighed.
1:08
And we're here to have a conversation the careful way,
1:11
so I don't think we should have a debate
1:12
in front of the Press on this.
1:14
But, the fact is the Senate -- the House Republicans
1:17
could bring up this bill if they had the votes,
1:20
immediately and set the town for what you want.
1:23
-If we thought we were gonna get it passed in the Senate,
1:25
Nancy, we would do it immediately.
1:27
We'd get it passed very easily in the House.
1:28
-No, that's not the point.
1:30
-Nancy, I'd have it passed in two seconds.
1:32
It doesn't matter though,
1:33
because we can't get it passed in the Senate
1:35
because we need 10 Democrat votes.
1:36
That's the problem.
1:37
-Again, let us have our conversation
1:39
and then we can meet with the Press again,
1:41
but the fact is is that legislating,
1:44
which is what we do, you begin, you make your point,
1:47
you state your case, that's what the House
1:50
of Republicans could do, if they had the votes.
1:52
But there are no votes in the House,
1:55
majority votes for a wall. No matter where you start.
1:57
-That's exactly right, you don't have the votes.
1:59
-You don't have the votes. -If I needed the votes
2:00
for the wall in the House, I would have them
2:02
in one session, it would be done.
2:04
-Well then, go do it. -It doesn't help
2:05
because we need 10 Democrats in the Senate.
2:07
-No, don't put it on the Senate, put it on the negotiation.
2:10
-Okay, let me ask you this,
2:11
and we're doing this in a very friendly manner.
2:13
It doesn't help for me to take a vote in the House,
2:16
where I will win easily with the Republicans.
2:18
-It will not win. -It doesn't help
2:19
to take that vote,
2:20
because I'm not gonna get the vote of the Senate,
2:23
I need 10 Senators, that's the problem.
2:25
-Mister President, you have the White House,
2:26
you have the Senate, you have the House of Representatives --
2:28
-I have the White House, the White House is done.
2:30
And the House would give me the vote if I wanted it.
2:32
But I can't because I need, Nancy,
2:34
I need 10 votes from Chuck.
2:35
-Mister President let me say something here.
2:37
-Mister President, let me undermi--
2:38
let me just say one thing. -All right.
2:39
-The fact is you do not have the votes in the House.
2:42
-Nancy, I do. And we need border security.
2:44
-Let's take the vote and we'll find out.
2:45
-Nancy, we need border security, it's very simple.
2:48
-Of course we do. -We need border security.
2:50
People are pouring into our country, including terrorists.
2:53
We have terrorists.
2:53
We have caught 10 terrorists over the last --
2:55
very short period of time.
2:57
Ten! These are very serious people.
2:59
Our border agents,
3:00
all of our law enforcement has been incredible,
3:03
what they've done, but we caught 10 terrorists.
3:05
These are people that were looking to do harm.
3:08
We need the wall.
3:09
We need -- more important than anything --
3:11
we need border security of which the wall is just a piece.
3:14
But it's important, Chuck, did you want to say something?
3:16
-Yeah, here's what I want to say.
3:16
We have a lot of disagreements here.
3:19
The Washington Post today,
3:20
gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios
3:22
because they say you constantly mis-state
3:24
how much the wall is -- how much of the wall is built
3:27
and how much is there, but that's not the point here.
3:28
We have a disagreement about the wall,
3:30
whether it's effective or not. -The Washington Post.
3:32
Not on border security, but on the wall.
3:34
We do not want to shutdown the government.
3:36
You have called 20 times to shutdown the government.
3:39
You say, "I want to shut down the government."
3:42
We don't. We want to come to an agreement.
3:44
if we can't come to an agreement we have solutions
3:47
that will pass the House and Senate right now,
3:50
and we'll not shutdown the government
3:51
and that's what we're urging you to do.
3:53
Not threaten to shutdown the government, because you can --
3:55
-You don't want to shutdown the government, Chuck.
3:57
-Let me just finish -- cause you can't get your way.
3:58
-Let time you shut it down you got killed.
3:59
-Yeah, let me just say something,
4:00
Mister President, you just say,
4:02
"My way or we'll shutdown the government."
4:03
We have a proposal that with Democrats and Republicans
4:07
will support to do a CR
4:10
that will not shutdown the government.
4:11
We urge you to take it.
4:12
-And if it's not good border security, I won't take it.
4:14
-It's very good border security. -And if it's not good
4:16
border security, I won't take it.
4:17
-It's what the bor-- -'Cause when you look
4:19
at these numbers
4:20
of the effectiveness of our border security,
4:22
and when you look at the job
4:23
that we're doing with our military.
4:24
-You just said it is effective. -Can I be --
4:26
Can I tell you something?
4:27
-Yeah, you just said it's effective.
4:28
-Without a wall --
4:29
these are only areas where you have the walls.
4:31
-We want to the s-- -Where you have walls,
4:33
Chuck, it's effective.
4:34
Where you don't have walls, it is not effective.
4:37
-Let's call a halt in it.
4:39
We've come in here, the first branch of government.
4:43
Article One, the legislative branch.
4:46
We're coming in, in good faith, to negotiate with you
4:49
about how we can keep the government open.
4:52
-Open.
4:52
-We're gonna keep it open if we have border security.
4:54
If we don't have border security, Chuck,
4:56
we're not gonna keep it open. -I'm with you.
4:58
We are gonna have border security.
4:59
-And it's the same bord-- You're bragging
5:01
about what has been done.
5:03
-By us. -We want to do the same thing
5:05
we did last year, this year.
5:06
That's our proposal.
5:08
If it's good then, it's good now,
5:10
and it won't shutdown the government.
5:11
-Chuck, we can build a much bigger section with more money.
5:14
-Let's debate, let's debate in private, okay?
5:15
-Okay. -Yeah, let's debate in private.
5:17
-Okay. -We have taken this conversation
5:18
to a place that is devoid, frankly of fact.
5:19
And we can dispel that. -We need border security.
5:21
I think we all agree that we need
5:22
border security, is that right? -Yes, we do.
5:24
-Good. -We do.
5:24
-See? We get along.
5:26
-Thank you, everybody.
5:29
-You say border security and the wall,
5:31
can you have border security without the wall?
5:33
-You need the wall.
5:35
The wall is a part of security.
5:36
-Are you redefining what it means to have border security?
5:39
-Yes. -We need border security,
5:41
the wall is a part of border security.
5:42
You can't have a very good border security
5:44
without the wall, no. -That is strictly not true.
5:46
That is a political promise.
5:48
Border security is a way
5:49
to effectively honor our responsibility t--
5:52
-And the experts say you can do border security without a wall,
5:55
which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem.
5:58
-It totally solves the problem.
5:59
And it's very important. -But I don't want to take this.
6:01
Unfortunately this has spiraled downward,
6:03
when we came at a place to say,
6:06
how do we meet the needs of the American people, who have needs.
6:09
The economy has -- people are losing their jobs,
6:13
the market's in a mood.
6:14
Our members are left--
6:16
-Well, we have the lowest unemployment
6:17
that we've had in 50 years. -Okay.
6:19
-Fifty people of the Republican party have lost --
6:22
are losing their offices now because of the transition.
6:26
People are not, the morale is not up.
6:27
-And we've gained in the Senate.
6:28
Nancy, we've gained in the Senate.
6:30
Excuse me, did we win the Senate?
6:32
We won the Senate.
6:33
-When the President brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana,
6:36
he's in real trouble.
6:38
-I did.
6:39
We did win North Dakota and Indiana.
6:41
-This is the most important thing.
6:42
We came in here in good faith and we are entering into a,
6:47
this kind of a discussion in the public view.
6:50
-But it's not bad, Nancy.
6:51
It's called transparency. -I know.
6:54
But it's not transparency
6:55
when we're not stipulating to a set of facts.
6:57
And when we want to have a debate with you
7:00
about saying we confront some of these facts,
7:01
without saying to the public, this isn't true.
7:02
-You know what, we need border security.
7:03
That's what we're gonna be talking about, border security.
7:06
If we don't have border security we'll shutdown the government.
7:09
This country needs border security.
7:11
-We agree to that.
7:11
-The wall is a part of border security.
7:13
-Not the wall. -Let's have a talk.
7:15
We're gonna get the wall built,
7:16
and we've done a lot of wall already.
7:17
-How big a part of border security is the wall?
7:19
-It's a big sec-- it's a big part of it.
7:21
-Is it everything that you need? -It's a big part of it.
7:23
We need to have effective border security.
7:26
We need a wall in certain parts, no not in all parts,
7:29
but in certain parts
7:30
of a 2,000-mile border, we need a wall.
7:32
-How much money?
7:34
-Uh, we are doing it much under budget.
7:37
We're actually way under budget on the areas
7:40
that we've renovated and areas that we've built.
7:42
I would say if we got, if we got $5 billion
7:46
we could do a tremendous chunk of wall.
7:48
-Are you willing to accept less, though?
7:50
-Well, we're gonna see, we're gonna see.
7:52
Look, we have to have the wall.
7:53
This isn't a question, this is a national emergency.
7:56
Drugs are pouring into our country.
7:58
People with tremendous medical difficulty and medical problems
8:01
are pouring into and, in many, may cases it's contagious.
8:05
They're pouring into our country.
8:07
We have to have border security.
8:10
We have to have a wall as part of border security.
8:13
And I don't think we really disagree so much.
8:15
I also know that, you know, Nancy's in a situation
8:18
where it's not easy for her to talk right now.
8:21
And I understand that.
8:22
And I fully understand that.
8:23
We're gonna have a good discussion
8:25
and we're gonna see what happens.
8:26
But we have to have border security.
8:28
-Mister President, please don't characterize the strength
8:32
that I bring to this meeting
8:33
as the leader of the House Democrats,
8:36
who just won a big victory.
8:37
-Elections have consequences, Mister President.
8:40
-That's right.
8:41
And that's why the country is doing so well.
8:42
-Let me just say this, what the president is representing
8:44
the terms on his cards over there are not factual.
8:48
We have to have an evidence-based conversation
8:51
about what does work,
8:53
what money has been spent, and how effective it is.
8:56
This isn't deba-- This is about the security of our country.
9:00
We take an oath to protect and defend.
9:02
And we don't want to have that mischaracterized by anyone.
9:06
-I agree with that.
9:07
No, no I agree with that.
9:09
-So let us have a conversation where we don't have to
9:11
contradict, in public,
9:13
the statistics that you put forth.
9:15
But instead can have a conversation
9:17
about what will really work
9:18
and what the American people deserve from us
9:21
at this uncertain time in their lives --
9:24
-One thing I think we can agree on
9:25
is we shouldn't shutdown the government over a dispute.
9:28
-Yes.
9:28
-And you want to shut it down, you keep talking about it.
9:30
-I want -- no, no, no.
9:31
The last time, Chuck, you shut it down.
9:32
-No, no, no.
9:33
-And then you opened it up very quickly.
9:35
-Twenty times.
9:35
-And I don't want to do what you did.
9:36
-Twenty times.
9:37
Twenty times you have called for it.
9:38
-Chuck. -I will shutdown the government
9:39
if I don't get my wall.
9:41
None of us of have said -- -You want to know something?
9:42
-You've said it.
9:43
-Okay, you want to put that on my -- -You said it.
9:44
-I'll take it. -Okay, good.
9:46
-You know what I'll say?
9:47
Yes, if we don't get what we want one way or the other,
9:50
whether it's through you, through military,
9:52
through anything you want to call,
9:54
I will shutdown the government, absolutely.
9:56
-Okay, fair enough. We disagree.
9:57
-And I am proud.
9:58
-We disagree. -I'll tell you what, I am proud
9:59
to shutdown the government for border security, Chuck.
10:02
Because the people of this country don't want criminals
10:05
and people that have lots of problems
10:08
and drugs pouring into our country.
10:10
So, I will take the mantle.
10:12
I will the one to shut it down.
10:13
I'm not gonna blame you for it.
10:15
The last time, you shut it down, it didn't work.
10:17
I will take the mantle of shutting down.
10:19
-That is no--
10:19
-And I'm gonna shut it down for border security.
10:21
-But we believe you shouldn't shut it down.
10:23
-Okay. Thank you very much, everybody.
10:26
[indistinct chatter]
10:28
-Press, let's go, make your way out.
